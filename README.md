# DataStructuresandAlgorithms
# So you may have seen some of my Learning Python code. 
# I got comfy with a few programs and decided I wanted to put my effort toward DS&A
# I'm hoping this pays off, I'd like to become a better SWE and believe I will.
# one day at a time, one step at a time, one Data structure at a time haha. 
# Thank you for taking time and looking at me learn this.
